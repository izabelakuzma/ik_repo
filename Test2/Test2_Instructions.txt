Instructions

In this problem, you will forecast the outcome of a portfolio of loans.
Each loan is scheduled to be repaid over 3 years and is structured as follows:
First, the borrower receives the funds. This event is called origination.
The borrower then makes regular repayments, until one of the following happens:
a) The borrower stops making payments, typically due to financial hardship,
   before the end of the 3-year term. This event is called charge-off, and the loan is then said to have charged off.

b) The borrower continues making repayments until 3 years after the origination date.
   At this point, the debt has been fully repaid.

In the attached CSV, each row corresponds to a loan, and the columns are defined as follows:
The column with header days since origination indicates the number of days that elapsed between
origination and the date when the data was collected.
For loans that charged off before the data was collected, the column with header days from origination
to charge-off indicates the number of days that elapsed between origination and charge-off.
For all other loans, this column is blank.

Objective:
We would like you to estimate what fraction of these loans will have charged off by the time all
of their 3-year terms are finished. Please include a rigorous explanation of how you arrived at your answer,
and include any code you used. You may make simplifying assumptions, but please state such assumptions explicitly.
Feel free to present your answer in and Jupyter Notebook. Please push Your work to Yours GitHub repository.
Also, we expect that this project will not take more than 3â€“6 hours of your time.

Comments and Remarks:
The dataset here is complex (has 50,000 rows and 2 columns; and lots of missing values), and the problem is not very straightforward.
You have to examine the dataset critically and then decide what model to use.
